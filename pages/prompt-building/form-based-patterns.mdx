## Examples of using form to provide structured context

<br />
<div className='w-full grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-4 gap-y-8'>
  <SampleUI
    src={Linkedin}
    appName='Generate job description in LinkedIn'
    desc='Linkedin help job posters to generate job description using AI. They collect context via a form to let users enter relevant information related to the jobs. This help build a structured context, makes it easier for AI to generate job description.'
    productUrl='https://www.linkedin.com/'
  />
  <SampleUI
    src={Notion}
    appName='Setup autofill in Notion'
    desc="Notion uses a simple form to collect the context for autofill function. This context will be uses for all the fields that user wants to autofill."
    productUrl='https://www.notion.so'
  />
  <SampleUI
    src={Synthesia}
    appName='Generate video from text in Synthesia'
    desc='Synthesia is a platform to generate video from scripts. They collect the requirement via a form then use it as content for the video. This kind of pattern is useful when the needed context is complex and required structured data.'

    **Problem**: AI systems often require specific, detailed information to generate accurate and relevant outcomes, but obtaining this data from users can be challenging without overwhelming them.

    **Example**: A financial advisory AI application needs detailed financial information from users to provide personalized investment advice.

    **Usage**: This pattern is essential in scenarios where the AI system needs precise inputs to function correctly, such as in financial planning tools, medical diagnosis aids, and personalized education platforms.

## Solution

Form-Based Patterns address this challenge by guiding users through the process of inputting the necessary data using structured forms. Key elements of this approach include:

- **Intuitive Form Design**: Creating forms that are easy to understand and navigate, using clear labels, logical groupings of information, and a visually appealing layout.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Presenting form fields in a sequence that makes sense to the user, revealing more detailed fields as necessary to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.
- **Contextual Help and Tooltips**: Providing users with in-form assistance, such as tooltips or contextual help, that can guide them through providing the required information.
- **Validation and Feedback**: Implementing real-time validation and feedback to help users correct errors as they go, ensuring that the AI receives high-quality input data.

## Rationale

The adoption of Form-Based Patterns in the UX design of AI applications is driven by the need for precise user inputs. This design strategy offers several advantages:

- **Enhanced Data Accuracy**: By guiding users through the data entry process, form-based patterns help ensure that the AI receives the accurate, detailed information it needs to function correctly.
- **Improved User Experience**: Well-designed forms minimize user frustration and errors, leading to a smoother and more positive interaction with the AI system.
- **Increased User Engagement**: When users understand what information they need to provide and why it matters, they are more likely to engage fully with the AI application.
- **Better Outcome Precision**: With accurate and detailed inputs, AI systems can generate more precise and useful outputs, leading to higher user satisfaction and trust in the AI application.

Form-Based Patterns play a crucial role in the design of AI UX, enabling the collection of detailed and precise user inputs necessary for the effective operation of AI systems. By focusing on user-friendly form design, these patterns facilitate a seamless and efficient data collection process, enhancing both the accuracy of AI outputs and the overall user experience.
