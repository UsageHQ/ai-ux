# Getting Context

**Gathering initial information effectively sets the stage for personalized and relevant AI interactions.**

Understanding the user's intent and context is critical for AI to deliver meaningful responses. The "Getting Context" category encompasses a variety of patterns that help AI systems accurately capture and interpret user input. Here's a look at the key patterns that facilitate effective context gathering for AI applications:

<div className='w-full grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6 py-8'>
  {[
    {
      title: 'Inputting Prompt from Scratch',
      description:
        'Enables users to provide initial input freely, starting the interaction from a blank slate for open-ended queries.',
      image: Scratch,
      href: '/getting-context/input-from-scratch',
    },
    {
      title: 'Capturing Multimedia Context',
      description:
        'Allows users to input context through multimedia, such as photos, videos, or audio, enhancing the richness of data provided to AI.',
      image: CameraIcon,
      href: '/getting-context/multimedia-context',
    },
    {
      title: 'Selecting from Existing Free-form Content',
      description:
        'Users can select relevant pieces of content already available within the application, facilitating a direct and precise context setup.',
      image: SelectContent,
      href: '/getting-context/select-existing-content',
    },
    {
      title: 'Selecting from Structured Content',
      description:
        'This pattern enables users to choose from AI-recommended options or structured content, streamlining the context gathering process.',
      image: Recommendations,
      href: '/getting-context/select-from-recommendations',
    },
    {
      title: 'Inputting in Form-based Format',
      description:
        'Provides structured forms or wizards for users to input data, ensuring comprehensive and accurate context collection.',
      image: FormInput,
      href: '/getting-context/structured-input',
    },
  ].map((pattern, index) => (
    <IntroCard
      key={index}
      title={pattern.title}
      description={pattern.description}
      image={pattern.image}
      href={pattern.href}
    />
  ))}
</div>
