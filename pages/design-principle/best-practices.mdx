# Best Practices in Generative AI UX Design

Designing Generative AI (GA) products requires a balance between accessibility, usability, and ethical considerations. Here are the best practices to ensure your GA products are responsibly designed and user-friendly.

## Accessibility

| Do ✅                                                                       | Don't ❌                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do use alternative text for images and other non-text content.              | Don't ignore non-text content which can be critical for understanding.                |
| Do ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.                  | Don't rely solely on mouse or touch interactions.                                     |
| Do provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content.            | Don't leave audio and video content inaccessible to those with hearing impairments.   |
| Do implement adjustable text sizes and contrast options.                    | Don't use fixed font sizes and color contrasts that may not be readable for everyone. |
| Do utilize ARIA roles and attributes where appropriate.                     | Don't create complex UIs without semantic HTML or ARIA landmarks.                     |
| Do include voice control and speech recognition for hands-free interaction. | Don't overlook the diverse ways users may need to interact with your product.         |
| Do test your product with a variety of assistive technologies.              | Don't assume if it works for one, it works for all.                                   |
| Do design with a focus on clarity and simplicity.                           | Don't clutter the interface with unnecessary information.                             |
| Do make error messages clear, instructive, and easy to navigate.            | Don't present vague errors that don't offer a path to resolution.                     |
| Do engage with users with disabilities during user testing.                 | Don't exclude diverse user groups from your testing phases.                           |

## Usability

| Do ✅                                                                        | Don' ❌                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do design for clarity, using language and icons that are easy to understand. | Don't use jargon or ambiguous icons that might confuse users. |
| Do create straightforward pathways to accomplish tasks.                      | Don't create convoluted processes that frustrate users.       |
| Do offer help documentation and onboarding tutorials.                        | Don't assume users know how to navigate your product.         |
| Do allow users to customize their experience.                                | Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution.                     |
| Do use user-friendly terms for AI-generated options.                         | Don't use technical AI terminology without explanation.       |
| Do provide users with control over the generative aspects.                   | Don't automate every part of the creation without user input. |
| Do give users the ability to easily refine and edit AI-generated content.    | Don't make it difficult to make changes to AI outputs.        |
| Do ensure that the system responses are quick and relevant.                  | Don't leave users waiting without feedback.                   |
| Do offer undo and redo functionality.                                        | Don't make it hard to recover from mistakes.                  |
| Do validate input in real-time to prevent errors.                            | Don't wait for submission to tell users there's a problem.    |

## Ethical Consideration

| Do ✅                                                                               | Don't ❌                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do design with the intent to enhance and augment human capabilities.                | Don't create systems that aim to replace human creativity.                        |
| Do be transparent about the data sources and training methods.                      | Don't hide or obscure the origins of your training data.                          |
| Do obtain clear consent for data usage and storage.                                 | Don't collect or use data without explicit user permission.                       |
| Do consider the long-term impact of the content generated by AI.                    | Don't ignore the potential for harm in the generated outputs.                     |
| Do implement mechanisms for users to report and remove insensitive content.         | Don't assume the AI will always generate appropriate content.                     |
| Do respect user privacy by anonymizing and securing data.                           | Don't neglect data security and privacy protocols.                                |
| Do continuously monitor and update AI models to reflect ethical standards.          | Don't allow outdated or biased models to go unchecked.                            |
| Do provide users with the ability to opt-out of data collection.                    | Don't make it difficult for users to understand how to opt-out.                   |
| Do consider the diversity of your user base when designing AI interactions.         | Don't create AI systems that cater to a narrow audience.                          |
| Do create feedback loops for the community to discuss and address ethical concerns. | Don't isolate your design process from the wider community and ethical discourse. |

By adhering to these do's and don'ts, designers can create GA products that not only perform well but also respect the user and society at large.
