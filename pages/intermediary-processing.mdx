# Intermediary Processing

**Enhancing user experience during AI's processing time through engaging and informative feedback.**

Intermediary processing is a critical phase where AI analyzes user input and prepares responses. Managing user expectations during this period is essential for maintaining engagement and satisfaction. This category includes patterns designed to provide feedback that keeps users informed and involved:
