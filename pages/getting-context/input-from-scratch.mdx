In the first message to initiate the conversation, they build similar UX to search or query products where they use suggestions to show similar query, this is a good way to help users form a better initial prompt. After the first message, the UX comes back to traditional conversation app.'

    **Problem**: Interacting with AI can often feel unnatural and mechanical,
    leading to a disjointed user experience. 
    
    **Example**: Users frequently
    encounter frustrating experiences when chatbots are unable to understand
    context or nuance in language.

    **Usage**: This pattern is primarily used
    in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other AI interfaces that rely on text
    or voice input.

## Solution

To address this, conversational patterns in AI UX design aim to mimic the flow of natural human conversation. This includes the use of:

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: To interpret user inputs not just for content but intent and sentiment.
- **Dialog Management**: To handle the state and flow of the conversation, allowing the AI to remember past context and manage the current state.
- **Contextual Awareness**: To recognize and use contextual clues from the user's current environment or situation.
- **Personalization**: To tailor conversations based on user history, preferences, and behavior.

## Rationale

The rationale behind conversational patterns is grounded in the human desire for interaction that feels personal and intuitive. Unlike traditional GUIs, conversational interfaces:

- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Users can communicate in their own words rather than learning a new system.
- **Increase Engagement**: A conversational approach feels more engaging and can lead to a higher rate of user satisfaction and retention.
- **Enable Accessibility**: Conversational interfaces can be particularly accessible for users with certain types of disabilities, like motor impairments that make traditional interfaces challenging to navigate.
