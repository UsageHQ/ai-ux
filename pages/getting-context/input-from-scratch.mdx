    **Problem**: Beginning interactions with AI without a clear starting point can overwhelm users, making it challenging to initiate meaningful exchanges.

    **Example**: A user approaching a creative writing AI without any prompts may struggle to articulate their needs, resulting in vague or unhelpful responses from the system.

    **Usage**: The "Inputting from Scratch" pattern is crucial for applications requiring user-generated prompts, such as creative writing tools, brainstorming assistants, and problem-solving bots, facilitating a user-friendly way to start interactions.

## Solution

To effectively implement the "Inputting from Scratch" pattern, several strategies are adopted to simplify the initial interaction phase for users:

- **Guided Prompt Suggestions**: Offering users examples or templates of prompts to help kickstart their interaction with the AI.
- **Incremental Prompt Building**: Allowing users to build their prompts step by step, with the AI suggesting additions to refine or expand the user's input.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Providing short, interactive guides that demonstrate how to craft effective prompts, enhancing users' understanding and confidence in initiating exchanges.
- **Feedback Loop for Improvement**: Incorporating a mechanism for users to receive immediate feedback on their prompts, with suggestions for improvement or clarification.

## Rationale

The "Inputting from Scratch" pattern is designed with the understanding that a clear and accessible starting point is essential for engaging and productive interactions with AI:

- **Facilitates Ease of Use**: Reducing barriers to entry for users new to AI interactions, making the technology more accessible and inviting.
- **Enhances User Confidence**: By guiding users in creating effective prompts, they feel more in control and assured of the relevance of the AI's responses.
- **Promotes Creative Exploration**: Encouraging users to experiment and explore different prompts opens up a broader range of possibilities for AI engagement.
- **Improves Interaction Quality**: Well-crafted initial inputs lead to more accurate and satisfying AI responses, enhancing the overall user experience.
