## The Structure

<StructureChart />

The structure of this patterns collection mirrors the natural progression of AI interactions, distilled into four essential steps: Context Building, Intermediary Processing, Delivering Results, and Refining Results. This framework reflects the comprehensive journey of user interaction with AI, from initial engagement through to the presentation of personalized outcomes. Each step is pivotal, underlined by the foundational elements of Usage Control and Monetization, ensuring that the products are not only user-centric but also viable and sustainable.

- **Context Building** sets the stage for understanding user needs and intent.
- **Intermediary Processing** keeps users engaged as the AI analyzes and processes data.
- **Delivering Results** focuses on how best to present AI-generated insights.
- **Refining Results** offers users the opportunity to tweak and perfect these outcomes.
