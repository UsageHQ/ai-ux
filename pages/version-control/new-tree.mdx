# Create a new tree when editing the result

    **Problem**: As users iterate over AI-generated results, tracking changes and navigating through different versions can become cumbersome, especially without a clear organizational structure.
    
    **Example**: A user refining a draft in an AI-driven writing tool decides to take a different direction with their content. Without a distinct separation, newer drafts could become tangled with previous iterations, complicating the revision process.

    **Usage**: "Creating New Trees" is an approach used in applications where distinct iterations of AI-generated content are common, such as collaborative design tools, content creation platforms, and coding environments. It ensures that each significant change initiates a new, separate version tree, simplifying version control and review.

## Solution

Implementing the "Creating New Trees" pattern involves structuring the application to initiate a new, independent version tree for each major edit or direction change:

- **Independent Version Trees**: Each significant user modification spawns a new tree, ensuring that iterations are cleanly separated and easily navigable.
- **Visual Tree Representation**: Offering a graphical representation of version trees, allowing users to visually track the evolution of their work and switch between major iterations effortlessly.
- **Metadata and Annotations**: Embedding metadata or annotations within each tree, providing context such as creation date, purpose of the iteration, or user notes, enhancing clarity and decision-making.
- **Simplified Navigation**: Designing the UI to facilitate easy movement between trees, supporting users in comparing different directions or returning to previous ideas.

## Rationale

The "Creating New Trees" pattern offers several benefits in the context of AI-driven generative results:

- **Enhanced Organization**: By clearly separating different lines of iteration into distinct trees, users can maintain a high level of organization, even in complex projects.
- **Improved Clarity**: This approach prevents confusion between iterations, making it clear which changes belong to which conceptual direction.
- **Encourages Experimentation**: Knowing that each significant change will create a new tree, users may feel more encouraged to experiment with bold ideas, secure in the knowledge that their original work remains intact.
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: In collaborative environments, this pattern makes it easier for multiple users to explore different directions without conflict or confusion, enhancing team productivity.

"Creating New Trees" as a version control strategy in iterating AI generative results ensures that users can manage multiple directions of their work effectively, fostering creativity and collaboration while maintaining clarity and organization.
