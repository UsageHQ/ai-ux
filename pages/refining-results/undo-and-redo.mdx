<div className='w-full grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-4 gap-y-8'>
  <SampleUI
    src={Midjourney}
    appName='Midjourney'
    desc='Midjourney provide a redo button to let users regenerate photos, button is attached right under the results. The prompt will be reused to generate new results.'
    productUrl='https://midjourney.com/'
  />
  <SampleUI
    src={v0}
    appName='Frontend code generator with Vercel v0'
    desc="v0 provide a regenerate button to let users regenerate the code. The prompt will be reused to generate new results."

    **Example**: A user customizing a digital marketing plan with an AI tool might choose to exclude certain demographics, only to realize later that the decision negatively impacts the campaign's reach.

    **Problem**: The absence of simple mechanisms to undo or redo actions can lead to user frustration, as it complicates the process of exploring different strategies or correcting mistakes.

    **Usage**: Undo and Redo functionalities are crucial in a wide range of AI applications, including content creation tools, data analysis software, and personalized planning systems, where users benefit from the flexibility to experiment and refine their inputs without penalty.

## Solution

Implementing Undo & Redo features enables users to navigate through their decision-making process with greater confidence and flexibility. This approach involves:

- **Easy-to-Access Controls**: Placing undo and redo buttons prominently within the UI ensures that users can quickly correct actions or revisit previous states.
- **Action History Log**: Maintaining a detailed log of user actions that can be easily accessed and reversed, allowing for a deeper exploration of different outcomes.
- **Instant Feedback**: Providing immediate visual confirmation when actions are undone or redone, reassuring users that their commands have been successfully executed.

## Rationale

The rationale for incorporating Undo & Redo capabilities in AI systems is founded on enhancing user experience by:

- **Promoting Experimentation**: Knowing that actions can be easily reversed encourages users to explore various options and discover optimal solutions.
- **Reducing Fear of Mistakes**: Users are more likely to engage deeply with the AI system when they know they can easily correct errors or revert unwanted changes.
- **Facilitating a Smooth Workflow**: The ability to quickly undo or redo actions streamlines the user's interaction with the AI system, making the refinement process more efficient and enjoyable.

Undo & Redo features stand as fundamental components of a user-friendly AI application, empowering users to iteratively refine results with confidence. By providing a safety net for exploration and decision-making, AI systems can foster a more creative and satisfying user experience.
