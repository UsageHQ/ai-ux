    **Problem**: Users can be overwhelmed or disengaged by AI-generated insights that are presented in a complex, technical, or verbose manner, leading to a lack of understanding and diminished trust in the AI system.

    **Example**: An AI financial advisor generates a detailed report on potential investments. If the report is filled with jargon and lacks clear recommendations, users might find it difficult to make informed decisions.

    **Usage**: This approach is vital in applications across various domains, including financial services, health diagnostics, educational tools, and customer service platforms, where clarity and relevance of information are paramount.
