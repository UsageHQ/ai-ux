   <div className="bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 px-16 py-10 border">
    **Problem**: Users may find generic AI-generated results less impactful if they don't directly address their specific needs, preferences, or questions.

    **Example**: A nutrition tracking app might provide generic dietary advice. However, users would find personalized suggestions based on their eating habits, health goals, and past feedback much more valuable.

    **Usage**: Dynamic Outputs are essential in applications that benefit from high personalization levels, such as recommendation systems, personalized learning platforms, and customized health and wellness advice, where the relevance of information significantly affects user satisfaction and outcomes.
